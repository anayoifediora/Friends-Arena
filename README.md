## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop a backend for a social media website where users can share thoughts, react to friends thoughts and make new friends. The backend includes the database for all Users, Thoughts and Reactions. It also includes *API* routes for users and thoughts; utilizing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) methodology to perform specific tasks following the user's input.  

The project was developed using *Express.JS* for routing and *MongoDB* for database structure. It also incorporated code libraries such as *mongoose*, *nodemon* e.t.c. The backend was tested using *Insomnia*. Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of MongoDB and Mongoose utilized for data mapping. I learnt how to query the database using Mongoose query methods.
